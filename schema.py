# To avoid confusion between the SQLAlchemy models and the Pydantic models, we will have the file models.py with the SQLAlchemy models, and the file schemas.py with the Pydantic models.

# These Pydantic models define more or less a "schema" (a valid data shape).

# So this will help us avoiding confusion while using both.


# create intial pydantic model / schemas
